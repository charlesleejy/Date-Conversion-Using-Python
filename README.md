# Date-Conversion-Using-Python

 Converts date string from slash format to dash format.
    Checks if input date is valid; if not, prints an error and returns None.
    Valid dates are as follows:
    - European date ordering (day-month-year).
    - Two-digit years are in the past century (1921-2020 is "past century", 2021- is not...).
    - The year of the date is in either range 00 - 99 or 1000 - 9999
    - An actual date that has occurred or will occur
